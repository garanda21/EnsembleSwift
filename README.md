# EnsembleExample

Simple example of using Coredata synchronization from iCloud with Ensembles library in Swift

I found that Swift examples for Ensembles library are rare, or don't exist at all, so I created one.
It is very simple.

It allows user to add entries to database which contain random data (generated UUIDs actually) and to remove them.
It syncs to and from iCloud and uses Ensembles framework. It's a small iOS application.
